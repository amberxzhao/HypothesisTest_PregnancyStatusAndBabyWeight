# HypothesisTest_PregnancyStatusAndBabyWeight

This project established three research questions based on the 1997 birth weight data
from National Center for Health Statistics to study the mother’s effects on baby weight. The
project focused on exploring the impacts of education level and smoking status of expectant
mother on infant’s weight and mother’s weight gain. 

Firstly, project defined possible factors to classify whether mother was a smoker by using
logistic regression. Then it studied the effect of mother’s education level on mother’s weight
gain via application of permutation test (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). Finally, project conducted
analysis on effect of mother’s education level and smoking status on infant weight by applying
ANOVA and cross-validation analysis. Each question was discussed by its rationale, statistical
model, SAS output, and conclusion. 

Project found that infant weight and gender, and mother’s race, marriage status and
education level had contributions to classify mother’s smoking status. Average weight gains
during pregnancy for mothers with different education levels were statistically significantly
different. Both mother’s education level and smoking status had major influence on baby weight.
